In this Assignment 17, we compare the Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM models.  I used GridsearchCV to find the best parameter for each one.  I also measured the relative training time to understand how long 
the training and GridSearchCV would cost.  Then based on the gather data, I created a table comparing all the models.
